        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK, this means your personal data may be transferred outside of these regions.

        <p>Generally, account information is retained as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Data related to specific features (e.g., logs, query history) may have different retention periods, which will be minimized according to the principle of data minimization.</p>

        <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data very seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. These measures include [Examples: encryption, access controls, secure software development practices, regular security assessments, use of secure cloud infrastructure like Firebase].</p>
